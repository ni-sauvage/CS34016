## A repo for [Intro to Functional Programming](https://teaching.scss.tcd.ie/module/csu34016-introduction-to-functional-programming/) as taught by [Dr. Andrew Butterfield](https://people.tcd.ie/Profile?Username=butrfeld)

### [Tests From Lectures](https://github.com/ni-sauvage/CS34016/tree/master/test-functionality) 
Small things I tried out during lectures to figure out just what Haskell was doing and to check syntax.

### [Exercise00](https://github.com/ni-sauvage/CS34016/blob/master/Exercise00/Exercise00.md)
A small first assignment in order to check that we had successfully finished installing the Haskell toolchains and stack.

### [Exercise01](https://github.com/ni-sauvage/CS34016/blob/master/Exercise01/Exercise01.md)
This first proper assignment. This involved a basic introduction to functional programming, creating functions that mapped a string to lowercase and finding the nth element of a list.

### [Exercise02](https://github.com/ni-sauvage/CS34016/blob/master/Exercise02/Exercise02.md)
This assignment involved expression parsing and evaluation using Haskell, as well as writing arithmetic laws functionally.

### [Exercise03](https://github.com/ni-sauvage/CS34016/blob/master/Exercise03/proof-check-master/Exercise03.md)
Finally, this assignment was showcasing the potential of Haskell - within a [Domain Specific Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language), in this case a theorem prover, we were asked to show simple arithmetic tautologies such that the DLS could prove them. 

### [Exam Practice](https://cs-exams.com/docs/introduction-to-functional-programming)
These are my solutions to past papers, done mostly in December 2022 in order to prepare for the annual exams.
